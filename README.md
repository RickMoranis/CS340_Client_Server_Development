# CS340_Client_Server_Development


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Some of the ways I can write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable are by writing code in smaller modules with specific jobs making them easier to modify, and being consistent in both the comments and naming of variables, functions, etc. in my code. The advantages of working in this way allows for reusablility by reusing components of previously written code serving the same purpose and scalability by being able to add new functions as the work goes on and has new requirements. I really enjoyed working with databases in this class and it has given me some thoughts about possibly pursuing data science after I obtain my degree.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach to the problem was pretty standard by starting with carefully reading and breaking down the requirements step by step. Then I looked back on the reading materials to help plan how I would solve what the project required to be completed. I would say my approach was pretty similar to most assignments I have worked on in other courses. The strategues I would try to use again are making sure the design is simple and effective at fulfilling the clients requirements, making sure the work can be scaled as needed, and always backing up both my work and the data involved with the work.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do many things including developing programs, algorithms, building databases, etc. in order to help solve problems. They also work towards creating new technologies to make many things in life more efficient and convenient.
